# Over Time: Paid

## Cryptography -- 50 points

### Description

After many months of hard work by our agents, we've gained access to a sensitive payroll document from a competitor. Unfortunately, it looks heavily encrypted. [document.encrypted](./document.encrypted) [source.py](./source.py)

### Hints

* Isn't it strange how each line of text in their document is of an identical length?
* Key Management is a difficult problem on the battlefield; maybe they reused key material in this document?
* Previous documents we've recovered had lines of encrypted whitespace as a result of text-formatting in the plaintext... Maybe that applies to this document too?

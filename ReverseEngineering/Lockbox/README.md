# Lockbox

## Reverse Engineering -- 50 points

### Description

We developed this password-protected [lockbox](./lockbox) which uses a super-secure, military-grade hash function with 256-bits of security to ensure only someone with the proper password can print the flag.

### Hints

* You do not need to crack the password.
* Tools like [ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) are helpful when strings isn't enough.
* Looking at calls to printf and puts is probably a good place to start.

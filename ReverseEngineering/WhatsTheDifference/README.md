# What's the Difference?

## Reverse Engineering -- 100 points

### Description

Of course it's safe to download programs ([npp.6.8.7.bin.minimalist.7z](./npp.6.8.7.bin.minimalist.7z)) from the internet. Although the official archive from https://notepad-plus-plus.org/repository/6.x/6.8.7/npp.6.8.7.bin.minimalist.7z is different ([official.npp.6.8.7.bin.minimalist.7z](./official.npp.6.8.7.bin.minimalist.7z))...

**WARNING:** There apparently is some not very nice stuff in the npp source. This was not known prior to creating this challenge (who would have thought such a well-respected binary would have such trash). 

### Hints

* Maybe the binary has been modified.
* You can try using BinDiff, Diaphora, or Ghidra's Program Differences Tool on npp.exe and notepad++.exe.

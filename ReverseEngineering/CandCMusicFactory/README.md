# C&C Music Factory

## Reverse Engineering -- 300 points

### Description

We've recovered a portion of the payload of a targeted malware campaign aimed at recording executives. Can you pull out the server it is trying to exfiltrate data to? [music\_factory](./music\_factory)

### Hints

* Only submit the subdomain as the flag
* Some of the control flow looks pretty convoluted... maybe you can patch your way through it instead?

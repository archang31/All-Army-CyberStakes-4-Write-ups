# PassThis

## Miscellaneous -- 250 points

### Description

Passing unit tests is harder than it looks. Use our sender: [send.sh](./send.sh), to test your code. Here's a base that you can start with [start\_tools.c](./start\_tools.c), and the header file it's based on: [mytools.h](./mytools.h). Go start the challenge!

### Hints

* Some string functions are REALLY unsafe, you should be able to find them online
* Using null pointers is usually bad news, checking for them is important

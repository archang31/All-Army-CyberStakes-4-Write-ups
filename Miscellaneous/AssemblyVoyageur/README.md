# Assembly Voyageur

## Miscellaneous -- 300 points

### Description

It's time for an adventure. [Begin your travels here](http://{{server}}:{{port}}).

### Hints

* A good traveler knows that you should bring the right tools for the job: sudo apt install gcc gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu gcc-mips-linux-gnu gcc-powerpc-linux-gnu gdb-multiarch qemu-user-static
* Some assemblers support pseudo-instructions that aren't defined in the Instruction Set. Other assemblers may not support those pseudo-instructions, but do support the underlying instruction.

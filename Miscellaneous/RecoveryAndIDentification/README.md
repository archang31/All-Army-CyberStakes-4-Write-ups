# Recovery And IDentification

## Miscellaneous -- 150 points

### Description

Given two out of three disk images used in a RAID array, see if you can recover the data: [disk1.img.xz](./disk1.img.xz) [disk2.img.xz](./disk2.img.xz)

### Hints

* [Creating your own RAID array](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/302766/persistent-use-of-loop-block-device-in-mdadm) would be a good place to start.
* Try to [use your existing array to assemble a RAID array with the given disk images](https://superuser.com/questions/962395/assemble-3-drive-software-raid5-with-one-disk-missing).
* The flag will be in one of the recovered files

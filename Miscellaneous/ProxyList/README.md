# Proxy List

## Miscellaneous -- 100 points

### Description

We need you to perform geolocation analysis on this list of IPs. We have attributed it to a malicious proxy network. Report back with the prevalent country of origin: [ips.txt](./ips.txt)

### Hints

* The flag is the name of the origin country (case-sensitive) found most frequently in the list
* Offline geolocation IP analysis can be scripted with a python package or two
* These IPs were collected in late 2019, if necessary you may need to use 'historical' geolocation data

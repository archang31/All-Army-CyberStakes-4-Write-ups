# All Your Base Are Belong to Us

## Miscellaneous -- 50 points

### Description

In honor of 30 years of terrible [translations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us), we figured we'd give you a try at a series of (easier) translation problems. All you have to do is to translate bases by connecting to {{server}}:{{port}}. In case you're new to network programs, we even have some Python [starter\_code.py](./starter\_code.py) you can use.

### Hints

* You *could* do this by hand, but is it really worth that much effort?
* While we only want the final encoding, it's probably easier to break that into separate decode and encode steps for each question.
* Don't overthink 'raw' encoding...
* Your code for encoding/decoding will probably be very similar for 4 out of 6 encodings.

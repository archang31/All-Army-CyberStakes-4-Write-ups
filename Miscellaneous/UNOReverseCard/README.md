# UNO Reverse Card

## Miscellaneous -- 300 points

### Description

We've done it! We found an open service that will run code we give it! It looks like the server is multithreaded though... Files: [uno](./uno). Listening on {{server}}:{{port}}

### Hints

* The flag is in a file named "flag".
* [Shellcode](https://bufferoverflows.net/developing-custom-shellcode-x64-linux/) doesn't always need to spawn a shell.

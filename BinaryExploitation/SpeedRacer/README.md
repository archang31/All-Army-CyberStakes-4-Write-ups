# Speed Racer

## Binary Exploitation -- 450 points

### Description

We're off to the races! Go Speed Racer, Go Speed Racer, Go! Grab the challenge [files.tar.gz](./files.tar.gz) and start the challenge.

### Hints

* The dastardly Car Acrobatic Team has setup a bunch of [roadblock](https://github.com/angrave/SystemProgramming/wiki/Synchronization,-Part-1:-Mutex-Locks) along the race track. Watch out!
* The race organizer has taken measures to ensure that we're all racing in the same [arena](https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/MallocInternals#Arenas_and_Heaps).
* Netcat (`nc`) is installed on the server
* Latency is known to affect solutions to this challenge. If your solution works when tested locally but not against the Docker instance, try launching your solution from our shell server (SSH is enabled).

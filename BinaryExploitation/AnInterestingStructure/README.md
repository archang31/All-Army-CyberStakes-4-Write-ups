There's a really cool simulator someone wrote that lets you run simulations of plants and animals. Check it out! challenge.acictf.com:60151 [structure](./structure) [structure.c](./structure.c)

### Hints

* No Buffer Overflows here...
* Heap Memory Mangement is hard, maybe there are some mistakes here
* What would happen if you could use memory after it's been free'd?

# All-Army CyberStakes 4 Write-ups

Write-ups and Walk-throughs for the challenges in All-Army CyberStakes 4 (AACS 4).

I am accepting Pull Requests. If you have a write-up that you want included (linked), please let me know!

**NOTE:** This repo is still the resources for these challenges, and they will be added once the competition returns in training mode.

## Acknowledgements

I want to directly acknowledge and sincerely thank the Army Cyber Institute (ACI) for putting together this amazing competition and financially supporting it year after year. In particular, I want to recognize the hard work of [Roy Ragsdale](https://github.com/royragsdale) who was the driving force behind the continuation of All-Army CyberStakes and spent countless hours both championing CTFing as a learning mechanism as well as pouring his sweat and certainly tears into picoCTF platform upgrades (like the on-demand challenges you all know and love). Finally, I want to recognize the amazing work done by [GRIMM](https://www.grimm-co.com/) (all capitals!) - they created some amazing challenges this year and helped make AACS 4 a big success.

# Kids on the Block

## Forensics -- 400 points

### Description

Help! I was ransomwared and payed the ransom. Now I want to track my coins down and [find the culprit](http://{{server}}:{{port}}).

### Hints

* You can access transactions pragmatically with geth's javascript API
* All ransom transactions will move the ransom value or a logical fraction of it (such as a half or a fourth)
* Contracts take arguments from the transaction input data

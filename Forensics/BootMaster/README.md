# Boot Master

## Forensics -- 75 points

### Description

We found another floppy disk [files.tar.gz](./files.tar.gz), but we can't get this one to boot like we did the last one. The disk had been sitting around for a while so we're wondering if some of the data was corrupted. Any ideas?

### Hints

* It looks like file floppy.img identifies this one as just "data"...
* How does file recognize that an image contains a [master boot record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record)?
* You'll probably need some kind of 'hex editor' for this problem.
* Can we change one bit in the image and fix the problem?
